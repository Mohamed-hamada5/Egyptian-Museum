  "text2": "amenhotep built a temple in taiba but was then completely destroyed, and also built several temples in taiba,and in karnak he built a temple for the god monto, the god of war who was the lord of the good territory and was replaced by god amon,and another temple of the god the death of the wife of the god amon ra.\n\nhe also contributed to the temple of amon, the main temple in karnak by building the third edifice of the temple, and was a faithful devotee of the god ra and built for him the temple of karnak to go beyond the priest that his mother was a foreign woman, and the greatest building erected by amenhotep in the goodness of his funeral temple, found traces in the delta, tora, in benha, manf, giza, cape and armant as well as in sinai.\n\nthe third sculpture is two sitting statues known as the memnon statues in tiba al-gharbia, each carved from one piece of red sandstone and 15 meters high without the base erected by engineer amenhotep bin habbou,and they were ying the façade of a temple the funeral, which was completely destroyed and is now standing next to the road leading to the royal temples and tombs of kings in the cowardly, and the reason for the fame of the statues is that when an earthquake occurred in 27 b.c., it shook a good area and led to the split of the northern statue in half. at the center of it, the stone sent sound vibrations through an internal act resulting from sudden changes in humidity and temperature at dawn, and there was a myth that the statue was making the voices of the mother of the ethiopian hero, munoun aurora, the dawn lord, on her son, who fell in troy square every morning, from which he took the name of the statues, and amenhotep iii issued many commemorative ja'rin, of which we know five geysers kept by time, the oldest of which confirms the title of queen tiee as the main queen."
